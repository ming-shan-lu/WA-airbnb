# Airbnb in Western Australia - MYSQL & Tableau 

In this project, I explore Airbnb in Western Australia listing data, focusing on understanding the Airbnb ecosystem in Western Australia. 

## Motivation

Airbnb has fundamentally changed how and where we travel. It arrived in Australia in 2012 and has brought with it a sequence of profound shifts
in the hotel industry and housing rental market. I am interested in how Airbnb plays in WA because it is where I live. 
By cleaning and analysing the dataset, I hope it provides some insights into the geographical distribution, property characteristics, price, and
duration of minimum stays etc. 

## Method and results

Tools: MYSQL & [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/WA_airbnb/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
 
Results:


         83% are entire home/apt

         98% are short-term listings (under 28 days)
      
         Most listing areas tourist-attractive regions: 
         
         Busselton, Margaret, Stirling(Scarborough), Fremantle, Mandurah, Perth, Albany, etc.
